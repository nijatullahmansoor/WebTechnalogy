            help in broadening our horizons but also act as doorways of connecting us with the world around us. They function as survival
            kits, they influence us and leave an impact on us. Want to know the benefits of books and the importance of reading? Curious
            about how books impact

            PODCAST:<br>
            TRANSCRIPT:<br>
            The second chapter of Leo Tolstoy’s short story “The Death of Ivan Ilyich” begins with the following sentence:
            “Ivan Ilyich’s life had been most simple and most ordinary and therefore most terrible.” I first read this story as a teenager and I can remember being more than a little struck by it; what is this “therefore”? Some years later I read Hannah Arendt’s Eichmann in Jerusalem, the famous subtitle of which is A Report on the Banality of Evil. Since the book’s publication in 1963 this phrase has enjoyed wide currency: evil is banal or, as Tolstoy would say, simple and ordinary.
            What does this mean? The word “evil” today most often has a religious connotation, but Arendt wasn’t using it in this way. What was she getting at?
